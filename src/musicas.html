        Take it from the top<br>
        If I start I just can't stop<br>
        All the patience that I've got<br>
        It's not enough to save me<br>
        It's a race against the clock<br>
        But we don't wanna watch<br>
        Keep running 'til we're lost<br>
        Got me thinkin'<br>
        <br>
        Pull it out of park, put it in drive<br>
        I can feel your heart beatin' with mine<br>
        Underneath the stars lookin' for a sign<br>
        Glowing in the dark 'til the sun shines<br>
        Made it pretty far on the first try<br>
        Might've set the bar a little too high<br>
        Started with a spark, now we're on fire<br>
        Started with a spark<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, baby<br>
        You take me on a ride<br>
        Gonna drive me crazy<br>
        Ooh, baby<br>
        I feel like we made it pretty far<br>
        Now we're stargazing<br>
        <br>
        Push until it pops<br>
        Tryna clear my thoughts<br>
        Better keep the A/C on for me<br>
        Not enough, yeah<br>
        Windows start to fog<br>
        Clothing coming off<br>
        Making it too hot<br>
        Got me thinkin'<br>
        <br>
        Pull it out of park, put it in drive<br>
        I can feel your heart beatin' with mine<br>
        Underneath the stars lookin' for a sign<br>
        Glowing in the dark 'til the sun shines<br>
        Made it pretty far on our first try<br>
        Might've set the bar a little too high<br>
        Yeah, started with a spark, now we're on fire<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, baby<br>
        You take me on a ride<br>
        Gonna drive me crazy<br>

        Midnight Blues<br>
        Summer Youth<br>
        Late at night I think of you<br>
        Bloomy skies<br>
        Sweet goodbyes<br>
        Late at night I think of you<br>
        <br>
        And I wonder<br>
        Do you think about me too<br>
        And I wonder<br>
        Do you feel the things I do<br>
        Or is it just me now<br>
        Or is it just me now<br>
        'Cause I can see clear now<br>
        No, I can see clear now<br>
        And I need you here now<br>
        <br>
        I don't need to know how<br>
        You feel the emptiness I feel inside, how?<br>
        <br>
        You make me feel<br>
        Like I can<br>
        I can fly again<br>
        <br>
        You make me feel<br>
        Like I can<br>
        Can be loved again<br>
        <br>
        Midnight blues<br>
        Sunset views<br>
        Late at night I sing to you<br>
        <br>
        You make me feel<br>
        Like I can<br>
        I can fly again<br>
        <br>
        You make me feel<br>
        Like I can<br>
        Can be loved again<br>
        Can be loved again<br>
        Can be loved again<br>

        Early sun shines through my window,<br>
        Your head's on my pillow<br>
        I<br>
        Spend time feelin' on that booty,<br>
        Caress you so smoothly<br>
        I<br>
        <br>
        Pussy wet like an ocean, aphrodisiac potion<br>
        We both took a sip<br>
        Both know what this is<br>
        Just looking for affection, added piece to my collection<br>
        <br>
        And maybe who knows<br>
        Let's see where this goes<br>
        'Cause the head's so good<br>
        And she brings me peace<br>
        We don't talk too much<br>
        But that's fine with me<br>
        <br>
        I'm lonely, you're lonely too<br>
        (Exactly what you done to me)<br>
        I wanna be alone with you<br>
        (Girl, your love is so comforting)<br>
        <br>
        I'm lonely, you're lonely too<br>
        (Exactly what you done to me)
        I wanna be alone with you<br>
        (Girl, your love is so comforting)<br>
        Hold me simple angel, inside your mind
        Miserable and painful, way down inside<br>
        Some winning, some losing like all the guys<br>
        Superficial boo thing, I want it bad<br>
        <br>
        Want you back, been running away<br>
        Running all around, all they do is<br>
        Turn and stay, oh my baby<br>
        <br>
        I'm lonely, you're lonely too<br>
        (Exactly what you done to me)<br>
        I wanna be alone with you<br>
        (Just can't let it go, girl, your love is so comforting)<br>
        (Exactly what you done to me)<br>
        I wanna be alone with you<br>
        (Just can't let it go, girl, your love is so comforting)<br>
        <br>
        Moon time smells like sex and flowers<br>
        We've been gone for hours<br>
        I<br>
        Feel fine, inspired completely, serenade you sweetly<br>
        I<br>
        <br>
        Pussy wet like an ocean, aphrodisiac potion<br>
        We both took a sip, both know what this is<br>
